                    Hello, I’m Mackenzie Miller, a college student dedicated to mastering the art of visual communication. Currently, I’m pursuing a Digital Media degree at Penn State Behrend, and I’m set to graduate in 2026.                </p>
               
              
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Academic Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Graphic design wasn’t always my path. I came into college planning to become a math teacher. Why did I switch? In highschool, I took two years of graphic design, it was the only class I looked forward to everyday. After graduating, I was using what I learned to do projects for my employer at the time. I had been at the job for 3 years, and they wanted to use my knowledge in both the job and graphic design, to create a training binder for the new employees. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole time I was disliking my major, and wanted to switch to something more creative. I spent so much time researching, hoping I could find something that I would actually enjoy. One day, a coworker at the time had asked me if graphic design was my major, and something clicked in my brain, telling me that's exactly what I needed to do.
                </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Notable Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    I get asked to do little projects for people here and there, and I love to do it. Most notably though, I do a lot of the graphic design projects for the Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity at Behrend, creating event posters and such. I am also currently in a digital media class, learning how to more of the technological side of the subject. I’ve created my own video game, and even the website you’re currently on.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Future Goals</h2>
              <p>
                  Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my career. My goal is to become a freelance graphic designer, but am also willing to work for a company. I believe that the knowledge and skills I'm gaining in college will prepare me to make a meaningful impact in the field of Digital Media.
              </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    When I'm not hitting the books, you can often find me outside, or doing some sort of art. I love nature and things like painting and drawing. These activities help me recharge and bring a unique perspective to my studies.
                </p>
